/* Hi! This code is tied to my analytics portfolio for a fictitious company, ABC AI. You can review the dataset that I used here: https://rpubs.com/rhuebner/hrd_cb_v14 

This portion of the analysis would begin once I understand the business objectives, interests from stakeholders and have secured reliable data from the project team. 

Prior to uploading this dataset to SQL (BigQuery), I did the following to the data in Google Sheets: 
1. Delete columns that were irrelevant for analysis (immigration status, marital status, etc). 

2. Divided the dataset into two: Employee_info and EmpID
- Employee_info contains information about the employee but does NOT contain the employees name in order to protect their anonymity during the analysis process. 
- EmpID links to Employee_info using EmpID as the foreign key. This dataset also contains manager names and corresponding manager ID. 
- Important to note that I would make sure to keep an original copy of the data to validate in later stages of the process. 

3. Validated data types in Google Sheets 

The following two queries deleted employees that were no longer employed by ABC AI */

SELECT 
DISTINCT(EmploymentStatus)
FROM Employee_info;

DELETE FROM Employee_info
WHERE EmploymentStatus IS NOT 'ACTIVE'

/* Used these queries to ensure that categorical variables were consistenly labeled */ 

SELECT 
DISTINCT(RaceDesc)
FROM Employee_info;

SELECT 
DISTINCT(RecruitmentSource)
FROM Employee_info;

SELECT 
DISTINCT(Sex)
FROM Employee_info;

/* Used this query to see if there were any NULL values in the columns that I will be using during analysis. */

SELECT 
*
FROM Employee_Info
WHERE GenderID IS NULL OR RaceDesc IS NULL OR RecruitmentSource IS NULL;


/* This query returned how large each department size was, which informed if I should group departments together and also informed some calculations I made later on in the analysis process*/ 

SELECT 
Department,
COUNT(*) as Number_of_Employees
FROM Employee_info
GROUP BY Department
ORDER BY Number_of_Employees DESC;

/* In order to save space, I'll include the SQL code that I used to calculate for one department. I used the same queries but simply updated the WHERE clause to change the department that I was focused on analyzing. */

/* Objective 1: Which Recruitment Sources should ABC AI continue to invest in? */ 

/* The following query allowed me to segment the employees in IT and Software Engineering by Recruitment Source. */

SELECT  
Distinct(RecruitmentSource),
Count(*) As Number_of_employees
FROM Employee_info 
WHERE Department = "IT/IS" OR Department = "Software Engineering"
GROUP BY RecruitmentSource;

/* Objective 2: Create a baseline dashboard on race and gender representation which would inform ABC AIâ€™s recruitment strategy. The following query created a variable of gender_count (I operated under the assumption that the authors used gender and sex interchangeably, I would confirm this assumption with the stakeholders if this was a real engagement), I then saved the view and calculated the percentage of employees by department */ 

SELECT 
Distinct(Sex),
Count(*) As Number_of_employees
FROM Employee_info
WHERE Department = "IT/IS" OR Department = "Software Engineering"
Group BY Sex;

/* The number 47 below was based on the department size from the previous query */ 

SELECT 
Sex,
Round((Number_of_employees/47)*100, 2) AS Percentage_of_Department
FROM New_View.Employee_info

/* After repeating steps above for all departments, I grouped employees by race. As a reminder, I seperated employee names into another table to protect their anonymity during this process. */

SELECT 
RaceDesc,
COUNT(*) As Num_of_employees
FROM Employee_info 
WHERE Department = "IT/IS" OR Department = "Software Engineering"
GROUP BY RaceDesc; 

SELECT  
RaceDesc,
Round((Num_of_employees/47)*100, 2) AS Percentage_of_Department
FROM Employee_info; 

/* I repeated this step above with other departments, saved the views and queries then exported the tables as CSV files. Afterwards, I imported the cleaned and aggregated datasets into Tableau for the dashboards. 

Thank you for reading! I'm always looking for feedback, especially as I continue to sharpen my abilities with SQL and Tableau. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any feedback! */
